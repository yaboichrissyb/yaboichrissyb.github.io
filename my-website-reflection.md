**How to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer** (for a non-technical person)

1.  Open your command line
2.  Open your go-to internet browser and navigate to https://github.com/<YOURUSERNAME>
3.  Select the "+" icon in the upper right-hand corner and scroll down to select "New Repository".
4.  This will take you to a new page where you will be prompted to enter a repository name, select an owner, enter a description, choose whether the repository will be private or public and to add a license.  For now, choose whatever name makes sense, make it public and choose the MIT license.  Then select "Create Repository".
5.  Go to your GitHub page and select your new repository.
6.  On the repository page, copy the HTTPS or SSH URL from the text box in the middle right-hand side of the page.
7.  Go to your command line and navigate to your desktop or whichever folder  in which you would like to store your new repository.  This folder SHOULD NOT be an already existing repository.
8.  Type "git clone" and paste the URL copied from the repository page on GitHub.
9.  Check to make sure the repository has been copied to your chosen directory.

**What open source means:**

Open source means that, when a compter program is released to the public, the source input as well as the output is shared as well.  Normally, as consumers of various computer programs, we only have access to the output, or what the computer spits out after interpreting the source code.  The open source movement or practice shares how the program was made and allows anyone to customize the program as they see fit.  Some developers do this for for altruistic reasons or as a branding strategy.  Others benefit from open source by allowing users to create useful updates to their platform without having to spend time or money on a new feature.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I'm all for open source.  Obviously, as a profit-motivated company, there are pros and cons and certain considerations that have to be made.  But as a source of education and transparency, especially for new developers, I think it's a great idea and should be considered by all.  It doesn't necessarily make me nervous or protective, but I can imagine certain pieces of code that I might want to keep private for a time.  Otherwise, I see it as an exciting educational and collaborative tool that could ultimately lead to greater efficiency and overall insight.  In this way, it does feel utopian.

**The importance of using licenses:**

Licenses are important but can be easily misunderstood.  When you licesnse work, you aren't giving away any of your rights as its creator.  You still hold the original copyright or patent to the work, whether it's a tangible product or IP.  A license simply grants specific permissions for others to use that work, however you, as the creator, see fit.  Licensing your work is a better alternative to simply releasing your work into the public domain or going through the hassle of individually granting permissions on a case-by-case basis.  Generally, licenses are attached to the product in a README.txt file.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

This challenge did help me better understand the concept of licenses and why it's important to use them, even in the case of the most utopian open-source distribution.  It also helped me better understand what open-source is and why certain individuals or groups might choose or choose not to use it.  Lastly, this challenge helped solidify the various clone/branch/add/commit/push/pull git commands we learned in the last couple of sections.  After a day, I did struggle a bit remembering the order of commands and why exactly I was pushing and pulling and creating new branches, but it was helpful to review and I now feel like I have a better understanding.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

To review some of the git commands, i used http://gitref.org/basic/.  It walks you through basic command uses and was a good supplement to the DBC materials.
