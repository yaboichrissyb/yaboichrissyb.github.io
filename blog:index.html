      <h2><b>Week 7: Ruby Classes vs. JavaScript Constructor Functions</b></h2>
      <h5>Jan. 24, 2016</h5>
      <p>After a couple weeks focused on Ruby, this week was all about Javascript.  So far, the two languages seem pretty similar.  They're both object-oriented and give the programmer a lot of the same abilities and constraints.  Right off the bat, the major differences between the two seem to be about syntax and user-friendliness.  Ruby was a language made with the developer in mind, where JavaScript, while not entirely unapproachable, has less of the 'syntactic sugar' that's helped make Ruby such a popular first language to learn.</p>
      <p>But, in general, I've actually really liked working in JavaScript.  It's been interesting learning about some of the same concepts in a different language; how each language handles them and what are the advantages to each approach. One of the obvious parallels we came up against this week is how each language handles object creation and method definition.  Initially, I did think they were basically the same, with only some syntactic differences, but after some more exposure and research, there are a few key differences to keep in mind.</p>
      <p>First, let's review how you create a class in Ruby:</p>
  <pre><code>class Dog
    def initialize(name, breed, age)
      @name = name
      @breed = breed
      @age = age
      end
      end</code></pre>
      <p>So, just above, we've again created class Dog and given it three properties: name, breed, and age.  We can create the same sort of object in JavaScript, which calls them prototypes, using the following constructor function:</p>
      <pre><code>function Dog(name, breed, age){
        this.name - name,
        this.breed = breed,
        this.age = age
      }</code></pre>
      <p> Instead of instance variables(@name, @breed, @age), in JS we call the variables assigned to instances of the  Dog object 'properties'.  The 'this' refers to the current object.  Now, in Ruby, to create a new instance of class Dog, we'd execute the following:</p>
      <pre><code>Kodi = Dog.new("Kodi", "Terrier", 12)</code></pre>
      <p>and in Javascript, much the same:</p>
      <pre><code>Kodi = new Dog("Kodi", "Terrier", 12)</code></pre>
      <p>Now, let's talk about method creation.  In Ruby, you give a class of objects a new method within the class definition itself like so:</p>
      <pre><code>def speak
        puts "woof"
        end
        end</code></pre>
        <p> In JS, this giving an object a new ability is done quite differently.  You can create a function, which is essentially a method or at least serves the same purpose, that is available to all of the Dog objects in your program.  However, it cannot be done within the constructor function and is not defined in the same way as a Ruby method.  In JS, you achieve this similar ability by using a prototype function that is available to all objects of that same type, created with the constructor function.  It's done like so:</p>
        <pre><code>Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
          console.log("woof");
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p><a href="http://nishacodes.tumblr.com/post/74145415546/javascript-vs-ruby-object-oriented-programming">Here</a> is a pretty good and simple resource for illustrating the differences between Ruby classes and JS constructor functions.  And <a href="http://raganwald.com/2013/02/10/prototypes.html">Here</a> is another good one that goes a bit more in depth.</p></article>
    <article><h2><b>Week 6: Ruby Classes</b></h2>
      <h5>Jan. 16, 2016</h5>
      <p> So far, you may have heard Ruby discussed as an object-oriented programming language.  But, what does this really mean?  Well, what Ruby does and what you've probably been doing so far, is take objects - whether they're strings, fixnums, arrays, hashes, etc. - and perform some sort of transformation with them using Ruby's vast library of methods.  Each of these types or categories of objects are called a class, and they each come with their own unique variables as well as methods that can be performed upon them.</p>
      <p>You can think of an object's variables as things it knows about itself, and, the types of methods that can be called on the object depend in part on the types of information it knows about itself.  For examples, as you probably know, you can't check the remainder of one string divided by another, and you can't capitalize an integer or float.  There are certain things (methods) that can be done to objects of class String that cannot be done to objects of class Fixnum.
      <p>So, this is pretty useful stuff to know for performing math operations and  sorting/manipulating other types of data; generally making good use of Ruby's built in classes and methods.  But, while Ruby has a pretty expansive library of these built in features, wouldn't it be cool if you could come up with your own?</p>
      <p>Obviously, even just this far into your programming work, you're probably well aware that Ruby seems to keep the programmer in mind at every turn.  Whether this is done by implementing semantic methods and intuitive syntax, or by including multiple ways to do the same thing.  And now, you'll see that Ruby has made it really pretty easy for you to create your own class.  And, not just that, but def variables and methods for your class that are easily callable for each instance class instance.  Let's look at how this is done with an example:</p>
     <pre><code>class Dog
              def initialize(name, breed, age)
                @name = name
                @breed = breed
                @age = age
              end</code></pre>
      <p>Ok, so this code just above is the bare bones of class definition in ruby.  You denote that you are defining a new class by writing <code>class</code> followed by the class name starting with a capital letter.  In Ruby conventions, classes always begin with a capital letter.  In this case we're defining a class of object called Dog.  Each type you define a new instance of a Random, Array, Hash or other class in your own code, it's necessarry to capitalize the name of the class.</p>
      <p>Then, right below that, we call the initialize method and pass three arguments: name, breed and age.  These arguments will become the instance variables of the class Dog.  Instance variables are what we were talking about earlier; the things an object knows about itself.  Now, this is maybe a little confusing since most dogs probably  know their name but not their age or breed.  But just think of it as things that you can attribute to this object.  We can give an instance of Dog a name, breed and age.</p>
      <p>And, moving right along, just below that we have the instance variables defined.  You do this with an @ symbol followed by the name of the variable.  Each time you refer to the instance variable later on in the methods, you will want to do so by referring to the instance variable.  Instance variables are defined across multiple instances of each class object.  Every you create an instance of class Dog, you will need to define its name, age, and breed.  Otherwise, you can go back into the code and define a default value for each.  This makes more sense for other classes though and not so much for dogs.  Dogs don't really have default names, ages, or breeds.  Let's look at the next part:</p>
  <pre><code>attr_reader :name
attr_reader :breed
attr_accessor :age</code></pre>
      <p>These three lines of code are super handy shorthand ways of defining three new methods for class dog.  We have two examples of the attr_reader method and one of the attr_accessor method.  We also have a third one available to us called attr_writer, which I've chosen not to use.  What these three lines do is quickly define methods that allow us to call each instance variable and return its current value.  You can skip down to the driver code and get an example with age.  The attr_accessor method allows us to both return the current age and redefine the age if the dog gets older.  The attr_writer method only allows you to change the instance variable value, it does not allow you to return the current value.  In this way, attr_accessor is sort of a combination between the reader and writer methods.  But, it doesn't always make since to def the accessor method for all variables.  Some variables, like name and breed, are unlikely to change for a given object.  Furthermore, you don't always want to make your variables changeable.  This can make troubleshooting and debugging more challenging in that it allows you to easily make mistakes.</p>
              <pre><code>def speak
                speak_array = ["ruff!", "woof!", "arf! arf!", "awhooOoo!", "grrrrrr!", "Hello, human"]
                speak_array.sample
              end

              def sit
                puts "#{name}, sit!"
                sleep 2
                puts "*#{name} sits!*"
                sleep 2
                puts "Good dog!"
              end
            end</code></pre>
      <p>Just above, we defined two new methods for class dog.  Just as instance variables are things each instance of the class knows about itself, you can think of methods as actions each instance knows how to do.  Every time we create a new instance of class dog, it will come with the built-in capability to speak and sit.  Often times, these methods call upon information stored in the instance variables, as the <code>sit</code> does for the @name instance variable.  All instance methods must be stored within the class definition.</p>
<pre><code>#Driver Code
kodi = Dog.new("Kodi", "Terrier", 12)
p kodi.speak
p kodi.breed
p kodi.age = 13</code></pre>
      <p>Lastly, we have our driver code.  This is outside the class definition and allows us to test our new class.  Entering the code above would create a new instance of class Dog named Kodi, who's a terrier and is 12 years old.  We then call the speak method.  Entering the driver code above yields the following output:</p>
      <pre><code>"woof!"
"Terrier"
13</code></pre>
      <p>Notice that when we called the breed method, it only outputs the name of the breed.  But, when we call the age method, this allows us to change the age of our pup Kodi.  The difference is taht breed was defined with the attr_reader and age was defined with the attr_accessor method.</p>
      <p>So, now that you know how to create a class in Ruby, go out and define your own!</p></article>
    <article><h2><b>Week 5: Enumerable Methods: Map</b></h2>
      <h5>Jan. 11, 2016</h5>
      <p><a href = "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">Ruby-docs</a>: Map: <i>returns a new array with the results of running a block once for every element in enum.  If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.</i></p>
<pre><code>(1..4).map { |i| i * i }
  => [1, 4, 9, 16]</code></pre>
<p> The map method, also known as collect, works through an array one time at a time, calling the code block once for each item and crating a new array consisting of the results of all ethis calls to the block.   Mapping a [5,10,20] array through a block that multiplies each item by 10 results in a new array [50,100, 200]. For example: </p>
<pre><code>array = [5, 10, 20]
array.map { |x| x * 10 }
 =>[0] 50,
   [1] 100,
   [2] 200 </code></pre>
<p>Like each, which map is based off, map walks through an array one element at a time and yields each element to the code block.  The difference between each and map lies in the return value: each returns its receiver (input) but map returns a new array.</p>
<pre><code>array.each { |x| x * 10 }
  =>[0] 5,
      [1] 10,
      [2] 20</code></pre>
<p>The new array is always the same size as the original array, but instead of the original elements, the new array contains accumulated return values of the code block from the iterations.</p>
<p>The mapping results in a new array, each of whose elements corresponds to the element in the same position in the original array but processed through the code block.  What map adds to our analysis of iteration is the idea of the code block returning a value to the method that yielded to it.  And indeed it does: just as the method can yield a value, so too can the block return a value.  The return value comes back as the value of the call to yield.</p>
<p>So, each is used for processing an array and map is used to do something with a processed array.  When using each, you need to explicitly return a return value, while map implicitly returns the return of the block.  If you want to change your return value, use map.  If you want to keep the initial input values, use each with the option to explicitly return the return of the block if needed.  In this sense, each is maybe more flexible but mapi smore immediately useful.</p></article>
    <article><h2><b>Week 4: Arrays and Hashes</b></h2>
      <h5>Jan. 3, 2016</h5>
      <p>Arrays and hashes are popular data structures used in Ruby, as well as C and Java, for storing all types of data.  You can use arrays, often in conjunction with hashes, to build and use complex data structures without having to define custom classes.</p>
      <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <p><a href= "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">Ruby-Docs</a>: Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java. A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array—that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on</p>
     <p> So, more basically, an array is a list of objects - strings, fixnums, floats, integers, other arrays, methods, etc. - that is stored and indexed for reference throughout the code.  What Ruby-Docs means by saying that an array is "integer-indexed" is that each object in the list can be referenced only with an integer.  For example, if you have an array called my_array and you wanted to access the first object, you would call my_array[0].  For the second object, you'd use my_array[1], and so on.</p>
      <h4>Hashes</h4>
      <p><a href="http://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Hash.html">Ruby-Docs</a>: A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs.  It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.  Hashes enumerate their valies in the order that the corresponding keys were insterted.</p>
      <p>This definition is more self-explanatory.  Both arrays and hashes are data-indexing structures but the method in which they index the data is different.  Arrays only use numbers, starting from 0, while hashes allow the programmer to define arbitrary keys with which to call the value at any point in the code.  Like arrays, hashes can store all types of objects, from strings and integers to other arrays, methods and floats.</p>
      <h4>One more time: What's the difference?</h4>
      <p>With arrays, you absolutely have to use numbers to 'index' into the array, meaning you always use numbers, starting at 0, to find out what's in the array.  Hashes, on the other hand, let you use anything, not just numbers, as your index.  Each of the two data structures associate one thing to another, they just do it in diferent ways.  Arrays automatically link integers with the objects entered into the array, according to the order in which they are entered.  This is sometimes described as giving the objects in the array "implied keys".  Hashes give the programmer the freedom to define their own index keys.  The reasons why this might be useful will (hopefully) become more apparent as we begin to look at some examples.</p>
      <h4>Example: Alphabet Array</h4>
      <p>Let's say you want to create a data structure that has every letter in the alphabet.  You'd probably want to use an array for this.  Since you only have one type of variable in the list, you can take advantage of the implied array key.  This array could be useful, I can't think of a reason why, at the moment, but I'm sure there's a use for it.  You can define it simply, as follows:
        <pre><code>
          >> Alphabet = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z]

          #Then you can access any letter:

          >> Alphabet[0]
          => a
          >> Alphabet[7]
          => h
          >> Alphabet[25]
          => z
          >> Alphabet[100]
          => nil
        </code></pre>
     <h4>Example: Favorite Things Hash</h4>
     <p> Now, let's say you want to create a hash that has different categories of objects and then a user's favorite of that category.  You could define that hash as follows:
      <pre><code>
        favorite_things = {
        'food' => 'Avocado',
        'sport' => 'curling',
        'city' => 'Juno, Alaska',
        'color' => 'Chartruse',
        'composer' => 'John Philip Sousa',
        'age' => 300
        }

        #Now, to call any object in the hash, use the key
        #you've defined:

        >> favorite_things[:city]
        => 'Juno, Alaska'
        >> favorite_things[:age]
        => 300
      </pre></code>
      <p>With both arrays and hashes, various methods can be called to manipulate the data within the structure.  You can sort the data variously, add to it, delete from it, index only certain parts to be transformed with methods, turn numbers to strings and vice versa, etc.  The limits of what can be done are only the limits of your creativity.</p></article>
    <article><h2><b>Week 3: Positioning Elements in CSS</b></h2>
      <h5>Dec. 20, 2015</h5>
      <p>Trying to successfully position HTML elements with CSS was consistently the most frustrating task of this past week's DBC workload.  Therefore, I thought I'd take the opportunity in my technical blog to do some further research and, more importantly, deeper thinking to try to wrap my head around the position property and how exactly to make it work for me rather than against me.  First off, let's flesh out some basic definitions so we're all on the same page.</p>
      <p>CSS is used for styling, formatting and positioning various HTML elements on a web page.  CSS takes the content from HTML and manipulates it or, from another viewpoint, adds a further layer of information for the browser to interpret.  The level at which CSS works is the HTML element, which CSS selects using selectors, that are then in turn manipulated using properties and their array of values.</p>
      <p>Every single element on a web page is a block.  This literally means that it is a rectangle of pixels.  This becomes easier to understand when you set the element display: block.  From here you can easily set the height and width of that element.  But, elements that are set to display:inline or inline-block are also rectangles, they just flow into the page differently, lining up horizontally as they are able.  Positioning is used to the blocks of pixels exactly where you want them in relation to each other and the web page as a whole.</p>
      There are four position values:
      <pre><code><i>position: static</i>
<i>position: relative</i>
<i>position: absolute</i>
<i>position: fixed</i></code></pre>
      <p><b>Static:</b> This is the default value for every single element.  It means that the element will simply flow into the page as it normally would as dictated by the HTML hierarchy.  Different elements don't have different default positioning values, they all start out as static unless altered by some element outside of your control.  The only time you would really need to enter a position:static value is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied from another element. This is fairly rare since positioning doesn't cascade.</p>
      <p><b>Relative:</b> This type of positioning is probably the most confusing and most often misused.  It sounds like it would mean relative to other elements or possibly even a parent element, but what it really means is relative to itself.  If you set position:relative to an element but no other positioning properties/values (top/bottom/left/right), it will have no effect at all.  It will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position:static.  But if you do give it some other positioning attributes, such as top:10px, it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be.  Once you understand what the 'relative' of relative positioning actually speaks to, you can understand that it's a fairly straightforward and useful concept to understand.</p>
      <p><b>Absolute:</b> This is another very powerful type of position.  It allows you to literally place any page elment exactly where you want it, regardless of the order in which your elements appear in your HTML file.  You can use the positioning attributes top/bottom/left/right to set the location.  These values will, by default, be relative to the next parent element with relative or absolute positioning.  If there aren't any parent elements it will default all the way up to the <html> element, which will then have you positioning your element absolutely relative to the entire page itself.  The most important thing to remember about absolute positioining is that absolutely positioned elements are removed from the regular flow of elements on the page.  An element with this type of positioining is not affected by other lements and it doesn't affect other elements.  This is a serious thing to consider when using absolute positioing as its overuse or improper use can limit the overall felxibility of your site design. </p>
      <p><b>Fixed:</b>This type of positioning is fairly rare but has its uses.  In fact, I found myself using fixed positioning a fair amount in designing my home and blog pages, though not without a good deal of frustration.  A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself.  The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled.  This can be useful for headers or navigation bars; elements that you as the site designer always want available to your user, even if they are scrolling down a long article page.  One potentially bad trait of fixed positioning is that it becomes more difficult to translate across mobile platforms and different browsers.  It generally has a cool effect and can be useful but needs to be thoroughly tested across platforms.
      <p> So, while reading about this sort of stuff can be useful if you've already had the frustrating experience of trying to figure out how best to use these four positioning properties, sometimes the best way to become more familiar with them is to practice and see them work first-hand.  I've found it useful to go back and review the content from our 3.4 pairing session to get more practice positioning blocks.  I also found <a href ="http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/">this</a> tutorial very helpful.</p></article>
 <article><h2><b>Week 1: The Command Line and Version Control</b></h2>
      <h5>Dec. 4, 2015</h5>
      <h4>The Benefits of Version Control</h4>
      <p>Version Control is the name given to a group of tools that allow developers (and non-developers, poets, writers, etc.) to track the progress of their work and create backups.  The specific tool we have and will be using in DBC is called git.  Git is a local piece of software that sits on your computer and works in conjunction with your command line.  In order to use it, simply type "git ..." followed by a variety of commands.  Another tool that then works in conjunction with git (which is working in conjunction with your home terminal) is called GitHub.  GitHub is used as a remote component to the local git software and allows users to upload, store, and share their version control output.  GitHub also functions as a significant part of the open-source community.</p>
      <p>Developers use git and GitHub in their working process for a variety of reasons.  To start, let's consider what the process of creating code actually looks like.  The basic workflow of the developer generally goes as follows:</p>
    <pre><code><i>1. you create things (code)</i>
<i>2. you save things</i>
<i>3. you edit things</i>
<i>4. you save things again</i></code></pre>
      <p>This last part is where version control comes most in handy.  Git gives you a clear sense as to when, why, and exactly what you did in each group of edits.  Optimally, each time you save your project, you also go to your command line and create a commit.  A commit is essentially a bundle of changes that are grouped together and labeled/described as a sort of checkpoint in the process of creating your something beautiful.</p>
      <p>Tracking changes might not seem like such a difficult thing to do on an individual basis, but it can become quite confusing/complex when you're juggling multiple projects, project components, or collaborating with a partner or team on the same project.  You need to be able to track who did exactly what, why and when.</p>
      <p>This is generally done by forking directories of files off one GitHub account or group and then cloning them to your local computer.  From here, you can create a branch to edit or add to the source code, saving changes along the way in 'commits' with detailed descriptions.  When you are ready to add your edited or new component part to the group project whole, you can check your git status then merge your new branch back into the master. From here, you can then push it to the GitHub repository and you, or whoever has administrative control, can pull this series of commits and merge it into the remote master.
      This all may sound overly complex, especially without practical examples.  But you can think of version control as saving checkpoints in a video game with multiple save files or as the "Google Docs" for developers.  It allows individuals or teams to collaborate in real time without stepping on each others' toes or damaging the source code.</p>
      <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h4>
      <p>Git helps you keep track of changes by allowing you to save edits as a bundle in something called a commit.  Each time you start working on a project, you can create a new branch off of the master.  This branch functions essentially as an alternate version of the original.  It is a copy that can be altered without damaging the original, but when the time comes, it can easily be merged back into the original file with all new changes intact.  To create new branch use the following command in your command line:</p>
      <pre><code><i> git checkout -b "NEW-BRANCH-NAME" </i></code></pre>
      <p>This command creates and navigates to your new branch.  From your new branch, you can add the existing project file you will be working on or create an entirely new one.  To add an existing file simply type:</p>
      <pre><code><i> git add "file-name" </i></code></pre>
      <p>From here you can go to your text editor and work on your file.  When you feel like you have made a substantial change, save and go back to your command line.  You will want to commit these changes to git.  You do this with the following command:</p>
     <pre><code><i> git checkout -b "NEW-BRANCH-NAME" </i></code></pre>
      <p>This command creates and navigates to your new branch.  From your new branch, you can add the existing project file you will be working on or create an entirely new one.  To add an existing file simply type:</p>
      <pre><code><i> git add "file-name" </i></code></pre>
      <p>From here you can go to your text editor and work on your file.  When you feel like you have made a substantial change, save and go back to your command line.  You will want to commit these changes to git.  You do this with the following command:</p>
      <pre><code><i> git commit -m "commit description" </i></code></pre>
      <p>Make sure to include a detailed anough description so it is clear to you and any others involved in the project what merging this commit will do to the final product.  It is best-practice to write in the active tense and not the past ("Add header" instead of "Added header").</p>
      <p>After you've committed your change, you can check the status of your project using the following command:</p>
      <pre><code><i> git status </i></code></pre>
      <p>This will give you some command line readout that will tell you how many files have been changed recently and whether the file is staged to be committed or not staged for commit.  Before you merge the file into your master branch, you always want to make sure your commits are up to date.</p>
      <p>When they're up to date, you can merge your branch with the master by typing the following command:</p>
      <pre><code><i> git merge master </i></code></pre>
      <p>Now your master branch is up to date with the new changes you've made and you're ready to push the new feature branch into your remote fork repository.</p>
      <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
      <p>GitHub is useful for a number of reasons.  You can create online repositories to store your code remotely.  This means that if something happens to your local version of a code, you can always restore it from the remote version.  GitHub allows you to work locally while keeping a remote backup.</p>
      <p>Probably more importantly though, storing code remotely allows you to share it more easily with others, whether they're a third party simply interested in learning how you created something, or they're directly part of your development team and need access to current or developing versions of a project.</p>
      <p>GitHub allows people to work simultaneously on a project without interfering with each other or damaging the original code by creating and cloning forks of the original author's work.  This creates an environment optimal for collaboration where each individual is able to alter or add to code however they see fit and, when they create something that amounts to an improvement, as deemed by team consensus or original author permission, this change can be pushed and then pulled back into the original source code with the author or administrator's permission.</p></article>
