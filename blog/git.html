      **The Benefits of Version Control**

Version Control is the name given to a group of tools that allow developers (and non-developers, poets, writers, etc.) to track the progress of their work and create backups.  The specific tool we have and will be using in DBC is called git.  Git is a local piece of software that sits on your computer and works in conjunction with your command line.  In order to use it, simply type "git ..." followed by a variety of commands.  Another tool that then works in conjunction with git (which is working in conjunction with your home terminal) is called GitHub.  GitHub is used as a remote component to the local git software and allows users to upload, store, and share their version control output.  GitHub also functions as a significant part of the open-source community.

Developers use git and GitHub in their working process for a variety of reasons.  To start, let's consider what the process of creating code actually looks like.  The basic workflow of the developer generally goes as follows:

you create things (code)
you save things
you edit things
you save things again

This last part is where version control comes most in handy.  Git gives you a clear sense as to when, why, and exactly what you did in each group of edits.  Optimally, each time you save your project, you also go to your command line and create a commit.  A commit is essentially a bundle of changes that are grouped together and labeled/described as a sort of checkpoint in the process of creating your something beautiful.

Tracking changes might not seem like such a difficult thing to do on an individual basis, but it can become quite confusing/complex when you're juggling multiple projects, project components, or collaborating with a partner or team on the same project.  You need to be able to track who did exactly what, why and when.

This is generally done by forking directories of files off one GitHub account or group and then cloning them to your local computer.  From here, you can create a branch to edit or add to the source code, saving changes along the way in 'commits' with detailed descriptions.  When you are ready to add your edited or new component part to the group project whole, you can check your git status then merge your new branch back into the master. From here, you can then push it to the GitHub repository and you, or whoever has administrative control, can pull this series of commits and merge it into the remote master.
This all may sound overly complex, especially without practical examples.  But you can think of version control as saving checkpoints in a video game with multiple save files or as the "Google Docs" for developers.  It allows individuals or teams to collaborate in real time without stepping on each others' toes or damaging the source code.

        **How does git help you keep track of changes?**

Git helps you keep track of changes by allowing you to save edits as a bundle in something called a commit.  Each time you start working on a project, you can create a new branch off of the master.  This branch functions essentially as an alternate version of the original.  It is a copy that can be altered without damaging the original, but when the time comes, it can easily be merged back into the original file with all new changes intact.  To create new branch use the following command in your command line:
git checkout -b "NEW-BRANCH-NAME"
