      <h2><b>Week 7: Ruby Classes vs. JavaScript Constructor Functions</b></h2>
      <h5>Jan. 24, 2016</h5>
      <p>After a couple weeks focused on Ruby, this week was all about Javascript.  So far, the two languages seem pretty similar.  They're both object-oriented and give the programmer a lot of the same abilities and constraints.  Right off the bat, the major differences between the two seem to be about syntax and user-friendliness.  Ruby was a language made with the developer in mind, where JavaScript, while not entirely unapproachable, has less of the 'syntactic sugar' that's helped make Ruby such a popular first language to learn.</p>
      <p>But, in general, I've actually really liked working in JavaScript.  It's been interesting learning about some of the same concepts in a different language; how each language handles them and what are the advantages to each approach. One of the obvious parallels we came up against this week is how each language handles object creation and method definition.  Initially, I did think they were basically the same, with only some syntactic differences, but after some more exposure and research, there are a few key differences to keep in mind.</p>
      <p>First, let's review how you create a class in Ruby:</p>
  <pre><code>class Dog
    def initialize(name, breed, age)
      @name = name
      @breed = breed
      @age = age
      end
      end</code></pre>
      <p>So, just above, we've again created class Dog and given it three properties: name, breed, and age.  We can create the same sort of object in JavaScript, which calls them prototypes, using the following constructor function:</p>
      <pre><code>function Dog(name, breed, age){
        this.name - name,
        this.breed = breed,
        this.age = age
      }</code></pre>
      <p> Instead of instance variables(@name, @breed, @age), in JS we call the variables assigned to instances of the  Dog object 'properties'.  The 'this' refers to the current object.  Now, in Ruby, to create a new instance of class Dog, we'd execute the following:</p>
      <pre><code>Kodi = Dog.new("Kodi", "Terrier", 12)</code></pre>
      <p>and in Javascript, much the same:</p>
      <pre><code>Kodi = new Dog("Kodi", "Terrier", 12)</code></pre>
      <p>Now, let's talk about method creation.  In Ruby, you give a class of objects a new method within the class definition itself like so:</p>
      <pre><code>def speak
        puts "woof"
        end
        end</code></pre>
        <p> In JS, this giving an object a new ability is done quite differently.  You can create a function, which is essentially a method or at least serves the same purpose, that is available to all of the Dog objects in your program.  However, it cannot be done within the constructor function and is not defined in the same way as a Ruby method.  In JS, you achieve this similar ability by using a prototype function that is available to all objects of that same type, created with the constructor function.  It's done like so:</p>
        <pre><code>Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
          console.log("woof");
        }
      </code></pre>

And <a href="http://raganwald.com/2013/02/10/prototypes.html">Here</a> is another good one that goes a bit more in depth.</p>
