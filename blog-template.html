-How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
This wasn't too bad.  We had done this before in challenge 2.4 so we both came to the paring session with out own ideas.  Conveniently, they turned out to be very similar.  We were both a bit confused as to why were being asked to wireframe our blog template a second time when we had already completed this in section 2.4, but we were able to compare each of ours and figure out what from each other's we wanted to keep or change.
-Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I do, even if it's just a basic sketch, it helps you get your head around the basic structure of your website pages and helps the actual coding go a bit more smoothly.
-What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Something that's not too complicated but clean and efficient.  You only need as many sections as necessary and you shouldn't feel pressured to use different tools or components just because they're available.  You want to make the page as simple as possible and user friendly.
-What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We used the <section> tag a few times and clarified our understanding of the <table> tag and its components (td,tr).  I also used the <center> tag to orient my header.
