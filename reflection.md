What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I already felt I had a fairly solid understanding of these three concepts and their relationship, but this challenge did let me practice with each some more.  One thing I hadn't really realized is that parent selectors pass margins on to their children.  This can be useful when you're aware of it but a few times I definitely got tripped up when I didn't realize where margins were coming from.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned more about the parent-child hierarchy and that I always need to be aware of which property values are inherited by children elements.  It's really easy to forget that there are properties that get applied sort of indirectly and, especially when positioning elements, this can cause a lot of frustration.  I also learned more about how to apply fixed positioning and that it's something I think looks good and is very user-friendly for headers and nav bars.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The smaller design elements like colors and text properties are generally very simple.  I still end up doing a lot of guessing and checking when I'm positioning elements, though.  Like I mentioned above, I often forget are am not entirely clear on which properties that are passed down are relevant for positioning.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I do feel like I have a deeper understanding of the relationship between html and css.  When you're adding elements you have to do this in HTML, but then you need to check you stylesheet to make sure you've selected all the relevant/appropriate properties correctly and in the right hierarcy.  It's very important to keep boths pages clean, organized, and linked correctly, otherwise your style and formatting choices won't translate properly.
